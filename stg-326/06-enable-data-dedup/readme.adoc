. From the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/[Amazon FSx] console, *_click_* the link to the *STG326 - SAZ* file system and *_select_* the *Network & security* tab. *_Copy_* the *Windows Remote PowerShell Endpoint* of the file system to the clipboard (e.g. fs-0123456789abcdef.example.com) and paste it to replace *"windows_remote_powershell_endpoint"* in the script.

. Go to the remote desktop session for your *Windows Instance 0*.

. *_Click_* *Start* >> *Windows PowerShell*.

. *_Copy_* the script below into your favorite text editor and replace *"windows_remote_powershell_endpoint"* with the *Windows Remote PowerShell Endpoint* of *STG326 - SAZ*

+
[source,bash]
----
$WindowsRemotePowerShellEndpoint = "windows_remote_powershell_endpoint" # e.g. "fs-0123456789abcdef.example.com"
enter-pssession -ComputerName ${WindowsRemotePowerShellEndpoint} -ConfigurationName FsxRemoteAdmin

* From the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/[Amazon FSx] console, *_click_* the link to the *STG326 - SAZ* file system and *_select_* the *Network & security* tab. *_Copy_* the *Windows Remote PowerShell Endpoint* of the file system to the clipboard (e.g. fs-0123456789abcdef.example.com) and paste it to replace *"windows_remote_powershell_endpoint"* in the script.
* Run the updated script in the *Windows PowerShell* window.

. Review the PowerShell function commands for data deduplication available using the *Amazon FSx CLI for remote management on PowerShell*.
* *_Run_* the script in the *Remote Windows PowerShell Session*.

+
[source,bash]
----
Get-Command *-FSxDedup*

----
+

. What commands are available?

. Enable data depduplication for the entire FSx file system.
* *_Run_* the script in the *Remote Windows PowerShell Session*.

+
[source,bash]
----
Enable-FSxDedup

----
+

. Examine your data deduplication environment using the commands in the table below.

+
|===
| *Command*
| Get-FSxDedupConfiguration

| Get-FSxDedupStatus

| Get-FSxDedupJob

| Get-FSxDedupMetadata

| Get-FSxDedupSchedule

| Measure-FSxDedupFileMetadata -path "D:\share"

|===
+

* Were all these commands successful? Why not?
* When is the next scheduled "Optimization" task?


=== Create new data deduplication optimization schedule

// IMPORTANT: Read through all steps below and watch the quick video before continuing.

NOTE: Complete the next few steps using the remote PowerShell session to the FSx file server.

. Create a new data deduplication optimization schedule. Run the following PowerShell command using the table values when prompted.

* *_Run_* the script in the *Remote Windows PowerShell Session*.

+
[source,bash]
----
New-FSxDedupSchedule
----
+
|===
| *Prompt* | *Value*
| Name
| DailyOptimization

| Type
| Optimization

|===
+

. What time will the optimization start?

. Examine the different options available to data deduplication jobs.
* *_Run_* the script in the *Remote Windows PowerShell Session*.

+
[source,bash]
----
Set-FSxDedupSchedule -?

----
+

. *_Copy_* the script below into your favorite text editor and update the *start_time* parameter with the current time plus 2 minutes. Look at the clock in bottom right corner of the remote desktop window. Add 2 minutes to this time and replace the *start_time* parameter with this value. (i.e. 5:32pm). This time is in UTC.

+
[source,bash]
----
Set-FSxDedupSchedule -Name DailyOptimization -Start start_time
----
+

* Run the updated script in the *Windows PowerShell* window.

* Wait for the time of the DailyOptimization scheduled job to pass (i.e. 1 minute after the start_time you entered above) and run the command below to check the status.

* *_Run_* the script in the *Remote Windows PowerShell Session*.

+
[source,bash]
----
Get-FSxDedupStatus

----
+

. Did the optimization schedule run?

* Look at the LastOptimizationTime value of the Get-FSxDedupStatus output.

. How many files were optimized and how much space is saved?

* Find the corresponding Get-FSxDedupStatus output for the command attributes in the table below

+
|===
| *Attribute*
| LastOptimizationResult

| OptimizedFilesCount

| OptimizedFilesSavingsRate

| OptimizedFilesSize

| SavedSpace
|===
+

. Do you see any optimization? Why not?

. Quickly read the *_Enabling data deduplication_* section of the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/using-data-dedup.html[Amazon FSx for Windows File Server User Guide] to find the answer.

* *_Run_* the script in the *Remote Windows PowerShell Session*.

+
[source,bash]
----
Get-FSxDedupConfiguration

----
+

. What is the MinimumFileAgeDays attribute value?

. Update the data deduplication configuration and set the minimum file age days attribute to 0.

* *_Run_* the script in the *Remote Windows PowerShell Session*.

+
[source,bash]
----
Set-FSxDedupConfiguration -MinimumFileAgeDays 0

----
+

. Update the DailyOptimization data deduplication schedule to run in 2 minutes.

. *_Copy_* the script below into your favorite text editor and update the *start_time* parameter with the current time plus 2 minutes. Look at the clock in bottom right corner of the remote desktop window. Add 2 minutes to this time and replace the *start_time* parameter with this value. (i.e. 5:32pm)

+
[source,bash]
----
Set-FSxDedupSchedule -Name DailyOptimization -Start start_time
----
+

* *_Run_* the updated script in the *Windows PowerShell* window.

* Wait for the time of the DailyOptimization scheduled job to pass (i.e. 1 minute after the start_time you entered above) and run the command below to check on the status.

* *_Run_* the script in the *Remote Windows PowerShell Session*.

+
[source,bash]
----
Get-FSxDedupStatus

----
+

. Did the optimization schedule run?
* Look at the LastOptimizationTime value of the Get-FSxDedupStatus output.

. How many files were optimized and how much space is saved?
* Find the corresponding Get-FSxDedupStatus output for the command attributes in the table below.
