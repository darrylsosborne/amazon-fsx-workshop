== Summary

This section will create a Continuous Access (CA) share for High Availability (HA) Microsoft SQL Server for active database files.

Microsoft SQL Server can be deployed with an SMB file share as the storage option for active data files. Amazon FSx is optimized to provide shared storage for SQL Server databases by supporting Continuously Available (CA) file shares, which are designed for applications such as SQL Server that require uninterrupted access to shared file data.

NOTE: It will take approximately 10 minutes to complete this section.

. From the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/[Amazon FSx] console, *_click_* the link to the *STG326 - MAZ* file system and *_select_* the *Network & security* tab. *_Copy_* the *DNS Name* of the file system to the clipboard.

. Go to the remote desktop session for your *Windows Instance 0*.

. *_Start_* *File Explorer*.

. *_Context-click_* *This PC* and *_select_* *Map network drive...*

. Map the file share using the following information:
+
[cols="3,10"]
|===
| *Drive*
a| Y:

| *Folder*
a| This is the UNC path of the file system's default file share. From the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/[Amazon FSx] console, *_click_* the link to the *STG326 - MAZ* file system and *_select_* the *Network & security* tab. *_Copy_* the *DNS Name* of the file system to the clipboard and paste it as the first part of the UNC path. *_Add_* *\d$* to the end of the *DNS Name* to complete the UNC path to the file system's hidden administrative share (e.g. \\fs-0123456789abcdef.example.com\d$).

| *Reconnect at sign-in*
a| Leave checked

| *Connect using different credentials*
a| Leave unchecked

. In the *File Explorer* window of the *Y:* drive, create new folder. *_Context-click_* >> *New* >> *Folder*. Name the folder *sql*.


. *_Copy_* the script below into your favorite text editor.

$WindowsRemotePowerShellEndpoint = "windows_remote_powershell_endpoint" # e.g. "fs-0123456789abcdef.example.com"
enter-pssession -ComputerName ${WindowsRemotePowerShellEndpoint} -ConfigurationName FsxRemoteAdmin

. From the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/[Amazon FSx] console, *_click_* the link to the *STG326 - MAZ* file system and *_select_* the *Network & security* tab. *_Copy_* the *Windows Remote PowerShell Endpoint* of the file system to the clipboard (e.g. fs-0123456789abcdef.example.com).

. Return to your favorit text editor and replace *"windows_remote_powershell_endpoint"* with the *Windows Remote PowerShell Endpoint* of *STG326 - SAZ*. *_Copy_* the updated script.

. Go to the remote desktop session for your *Windows Instance 0*.

. *_Click_* *Start* >> *Windows PowerShell*.

. *_Run_* the updated script in the *Windows PowerShell* window.

Windows Server Failover Cluster deployments commonly deploy an SMB file share witness to maintain quorum of the clusterâ€™s resources. Witness file shares require only a small amount of storage for quorum information. Amazon FSx file systems can be used as an SMB file share witness for Windows Server Failover Cluster deployments.
