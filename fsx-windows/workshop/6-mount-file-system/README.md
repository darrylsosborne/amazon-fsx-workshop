### Mount file system

You must first complete [**Prerequisites**](../0-prerequisites) and the previous step [**Backup file system**](../5-backup-file-system)

WARNING!! This workshop environment will exceed your free-usage tier. You will incur charges as a result of building this environment and completing the steps below.

### Step 6.1: Log on to the Linux EC2 instance

- From the Amazon EC2 Console, select the **Amazon Linux - FSx Workshop** instance
- Click **Connect**
- Use the connection information to SSH to the instance using your laptop's terminal application

### Step 6.2: Install linux applications

> Complete the following steps SSH'd in to the **Amazon Linux - FSx Workshop** instance

- Run the following script
- **cifs-utils** is the only utility needed to mount the FSX for Windows file system on Amazon Linux, the other utilites will be used for testing and monitoring performance

```sh
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y parallel tree git cifs-utils
sudo yum install -y --enablerepo=epel nload ioping
git clone https://github.com/bengland2/smallfile.git

```

### Step 6.3: Mount the file system's default file share

> Complete the following steps SSH'd in to the **Amazon Linux - FSx Workshop** instance

- Run the following script to create a local mount point and mount the file system
- You will be prompted to enter the password of the AD user **admin** (e.g. admin@example.com)

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/fsx/share
# for example: sudo mount -t cifs //fs-0123456789abcdef.example.com/share /mnt/fsx/share --verbose -o vers=2.0,user=admin@example.com
sudo mount -t cifs //<file-system-dns-name>/share /mnt/fsx/share --verbose -o vers=2.0,user=admin@<domain>
```

- Run **df** to verfify the file share has been mounted correctly

```sh
df
```

- Experiment and mount the file shares you created in the previous section. Use the following table to mount each share to a different local mount point. Remember to create the local mount point first before mounting the file share.

| Local mount point | File share |
| :--- | :--- |
| /mnt/fsx/data | data |
| /mnt/fsx/finance | finance |
| /mnt/fsx/sales | sales |
| /mnt/fsx/marketing | marketing |

- Were you able to mount all file shares?
- Why not?

- Run **df** to verfify all file shares have been mounted correctly

```sh
df
```

- Can you mount a single file share and gain access all the sub-shares?
- Try this

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/fsx
# for example: sudo mount -t cifs //fs-0123456789abcdef.example.com/share /mnt/fsx/share --verbose -o vers=2.0,user=admin@example.com
sudo mount -t cifs //<file-system-dns-name>/d$ /mnt/fsx --verbose -o vers=2.0,user=admin@<domain>
```

- Run a simple touch command to write to the /share file share.

```sh
touch amazon_linux_test.txt
```

- What two things can you do to write to these shares?

```sh
sudo touch amazon_linux_test.txt
```

```sh
sudo chown ec2-user:ec2-user /mnt/fsx/share
touch amazon_linux_test.txt
```


### Step 6.4: Run performance tests

> Complete the following steps SSH'd in to the **Amazon Linux - FSx Workshop** instance

- Run scripts below to evaluate file share performance. Change the path to access any of the file shares you've created (e.g. of=/mnt/fsx/share, of=/mnt/fsx/data, of=/mnt/fsx/marketing, etc.)

```sh
time sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/fsx/share/2G-fsx-dd-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S.%3N) bs=1M count=2048 status=progress conv=fsync
```
```sh
time sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/fsx/share/2G-fsx-dd-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S.%3N) bs=1M count=2048 status=progress oflag=sync
```
```sh
job_name=$(echo $(uuidgen)| grep -o ".\{6\}$")
bs=1024K
count=256
sync=oflag=sync
threads=128

sudo mkdir -p /mnt/fsx/share/${job_name}/{1..128}

time seq 1 ${threads} | sudo parallel --will-cite -j ${threads} dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/fsx/share/${job_name}/{}/dd-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S.%3N) bs=${bs} count=${count} ${sync} &
```

- While the parallel dd command is running, run the **nload** command below for 10-20 seconds to monitor network throughput in real time
- Exit **nload** by pressing **Control+z**
- How long did it take to generate 32 GiB of data across 128 files?
- What was the average throughput of this test?

```sh
job_name=$(echo $(uuidgen)| grep -o ".\{6\}$")
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/fsx/share/${job_name}
threads=16
file_size=1024
file_count=1024
sudo python ~/smallfile/smallfile_cli.py \
--operation create \
--threads ${threads} \
--file-size ${file_size} \
--files ${file_count} \
--same-dir N \
--dirs-per-dir ${file_count} \
--hash-into-dirs Y \
--files-per-dir ${file_count} \
--prefix $(echo $(uuidgen)| grep -o ".\{6\}$") \
--top /mnt/fsx/share/${job_name} &


```





- If you adjust the share permissions from the **Windows Server 2016 - FSx Workshop** instance, can you get

- Open **File Explorer**
- Context-click **This PC** and click **Map network drive...**
- Map the file share using the following information, 

| Configuraiton detail | Value 
| :--- | :--- 
| Drive | Z:
| Folder | UNC path of the file system's default file share using the DNS name you copied above - **\\\\<file system's DNS name>\share** - (e.g. **\\\\fs-0123456789abcdef.example.com\share**)
| Reconnect at sign-in | Leave **checked**
| Connect using different credentials | Leave **unchecked**

### Step 3.3: Access a file share

> Complete the following steps logged on to the **Windows Server 2016 - FSx Workshop** instance

- In the **File Explorer** window of the **Z:**
- Create new empty files on the **Z:** drive
- Context-click >> **New** >> **Text Document**
- Create a few different types of files

### Step 3.3: Test the performance of the new file share

> Complete the following steps logged on to the **Windows Server 2016 - FSx Workshop** instance

- Open a **PowerShell** window as an **Administrator**
- Install DiskSpeed using the script below. Copy >> Paste >> Execute the script in the PowerShell window

```sh
$path = "C:\Tools\DiskSpd-2.0.21a"
$url = "https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/DiskSpd-A-Robust-Storage-6ef84e62/file/199535/2/DiskSpd-2.0.21a.zip"
$destination = "C:\Tools\DiskSpd-2.0.21a.zip"
$download = New-Object -Typename System.Net.WebClient
New-Item -Type Directory -Path $path
$download.DownloadFile($url,$destination)

$extract = New-Object -ComObject Shell.Application
$files = $extract.Namespace($destination).Items()
$extract.NameSpace($path).CopyHere($files)

```

- Open a new **PowerShell** window **NOT** as **Administrator**
- Run the DiskSpeed script below to test write performance of the mapped **Z:** drive

```sh
C:\Tools\DiskSpd-2.0.21a\amd64\DiskSpd.exe -b16K -c4G -o4 -t8 -w25 -r -L -d30 -Z1G Z:\${env:computername}.dat
```

- While the script is running, open **Task Explorer** and monitor network performance (e.g. Task Explorer >> Performance (tab) >> Ethernet)

- What was the peak write throughput you achieved?
- What was the peak read throughput you achieved?
- What was the P99 (99th %-tile) of your test?


- Experiment with different DiskSpd parameter settings. Use the table below was a guide. Test with different block sizes (-b), file sizes (-c), number of outstanding I/O requests (-o), number of threads per file (-t), and read/write ratio (-w).

| Parameter | Description 
| :--- | :--- 
| `-b<size>[K\|M\|G]` | Block size in bytes or KiB, MiB, or GiB (default = 64K). |
| `-c<size>[K\|M\|G\|b]` | Create files of the specified size. Size can be stated in bytes or KiBs, MiBs, GiBs, or blocks. |
| `-o<count>` | Number of outstanding I/O requests per-target per-thread. (1 = synchronous I/O, unless more than one thread is specified with by using `-F`.) (default = 2) |
| `-t<count>` | Number of threads per target. Conflicts with `-F`, which specifies the total number of threads. |
| `-w<percentage>` | Percentage of write requests to issue (default = 0, 100% read). The following are equivalent and result in a 100% read-only workload: omitting `-w`, specifying `-w` with no percentage and `-w0`. **CAUTION**: A write test will destroy existing data without issuing a warning. |

- What different parameters did you test?
- How did the different parameter options alter the results?
