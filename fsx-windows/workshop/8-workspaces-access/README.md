### Map from WorkSpaces

You must first complete [**Prerequisites**](../0-prerequisites) and the previous step [**Create a file system**](../2-launch-clients)

WARNING!! This workshop environment will exceed your free-usage tier. You will incur charges as a result of building this environment and completing the steps below.

### Step 8.1: Log on to the Windows WorkSpace

- You should have received two emails from @...amazonworkspaces.com with login information for the two WorkSpaces you created earlier in the Workshop.
- Read the email related to the Windows WorkSpace (for the username **burton**)
- Complete the steps to login to the Windows WorkSpace

### Step 8.2: Copy the DNS name of the FSx for Windows file system

- From the Amazon FSx Console select the file system you created in the **Create a file system** section.
- Click the **Network & Security** tab.
- Copy the **DNS name** of the file system

### Step 8.3: Map one of the file system's file shares

> Complete the following steps logged on to the **Windows WorkSpace**

- Open **File Explorer**
- Context-click **This PC** and click **Map network drive...**
- Map the file share using the following information, 

| Configuraiton detail | Value 
| :--- | :--- 
| Drive | Z:
| Folder | UNC path of one of the file system's file shares you created earlier - using the DNS name you copied above - **\\\\<file system's DNS name>\share** - (e.g. **\\\\fs-0123456789abcdef.example.com\share**)
| Reconnect at sign-in | Leave **checked**
| Connect using different credentials | Leave **unchecked**

- Were you able to map the file share?
- Why not?
- How do you troubleshoot?
- Hint: Could it be related to network traffic access?
- If you can't figure it out... come see me at the front of the room.

### Step 8.4: Access a file share

> Complete the following steps logged on to the **Windows WorkSpace**

- In the **File Explorer** window of the **Z:**
- Create new empty files on the **Z:** drive
- Context-click >> **New** >> **Text Document**
- Create a few different types of files

### Step 8.5: Test the performance of the new file share

> Complete the following steps logged on to the **Windows WorkSpace**

- Open a **PowerShell** window as an **Administrator**
- Install DiskSpeed using the script below. Copy >> Paste >> Execute the script in the PowerShell window

```sh
$path = "C:\Tools\DiskSpd-2.0.21a"
$url = "https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/DiskSpd-A-Robust-Storage-6ef84e62/file/199535/2/DiskSpd-2.0.21a.zip"
$destination = "C:\Tools\DiskSpd-2.0.21a.zip"
$download = New-Object -Typename System.Net.WebClient
New-Item -Type Directory -Path $path
$download.DownloadFile($url,$destination)

$extract = New-Object -ComObject Shell.Application
$files = $extract.Namespace($destination).Items()
$extract.NameSpace($path).CopyHere($files)

```

- Open a new **PowerShell** window **NOT** as **Administrator**
- Run the DiskSpeed script below to test write performance of the mapped **Z:** drive

```sh
C:\Tools\DiskSpd-2.0.21a\amd64\DiskSpd.exe -b16K -c4G -o4 -t8 -w25 -r -L -d30 -Z1G Z:\${env:computername}.dat
```

- While the script is running, open **Task Explorer** and monitor network performance (e.g. Task Explorer >> Performance (tab) >> Ethernet)

- What was the peak write throughput you achieved?
- What was the peak read throughput you achieved?
- What was the P99 (99th %-tile) of your test?
- How is this different from the Windows instance test you ran eariler?

- Experiment with different DiskSpd parameter settings. Use the table below was a guide. Test with different block sizes (-b), file sizes (-c), number of outstanding I/O requests (-o), number of threads per file (-t), and read/write ratio (-w).

| Parameter | Description 
| :--- | :--- 
| `-b<size>[K\|M\|G]` | Block size in bytes or KiB, MiB, or GiB (default = 64K). |
| `-c<size>[K\|M\|G\|b]` | Create files of the specified size. Size can be stated in bytes or KiBs, MiBs, GiBs, or blocks. |
| `-o<count>` | Number of outstanding I/O requests per-target per-thread. (1 = synchronous I/O, unless more than one thread is specified with by using `-F`.) (default = 2) |
| `-t<count>` | Number of threads per target. Conflicts with `-F`, which specifies the total number of threads. |
| `-w<percentage>` | Percentage of write requests to issue (default = 0, 100% read). The following are equivalent and result in a 100% read-only workload: omitting `-w`, specifying `-w` with no percentage and `-w0`. **CAUTION**: A write test will destroy existing data without issuing a warning. |

- What different parameters did you test?
- How did the different parameter options alter the results?

### Step 8.6: Log on to the Linux WorkSpace

- You should have received two emails from @...amazonworkspaces.com with login information for the two WorkSpaces you created earlier in the Workshop.
- Read the email related to the Linux WorkSpace (for the username **shawn**)
- Complete the steps to login to the Linux WorkSpace

### Step 8.7: Install linux applications

> Complete the following steps logged in to the **Amazon Linux WorkSpace**

- Launch **Mate Terminal**
- Run the following scripts in the terminal window
- **cifs-utils** is the only utility needed to mount the FSX for Windows file system on Amazon Linux, the other utilites will be used for testing and monitoring performance

```sh
sudo amazon-linux-extras install -y epel
sudo yum install -y parallel cifs-utils ioping nload
sudo yum update -y

git clone https://github.com/bengland2/smallfile.git

```

### Step 8.8: Mount the file system's default file shares

> Complete the following steps in the terminal window of the **Amazon Linux WorkSpace** 

- Run the following command to create a local mount point and mount the file system
- Update the command with the appropriate user's domain name and the DNS name of the file system 

```sh
mkdir -p /mnt/fsx/share
# for example: sudo mount -t cifs -o vers=3.0,sec=krb5,cruid=shawn@example.com //fs-01234566789abcdef.example.com/share /mnt/fsx/share
sudo mount -t cifs -o vers=3.0,sec=krb5,cruid=shawn@<domain-name> //<file-system-dns-name>/share /mnt/fsx/share
```

- Run **df** to verfify the file share has been mounted correctly

```sh
df
```

- Run a few performance tests against the file system

```sh
time sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/fsx/share/2G-fsx-dd-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S.%3N) bs=1M count=2048 status=progress conv=fsync
```
```sh
time sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/fsx/share/2G-fsx-dd-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S.%3N) bs=1M count=2048 status=progress oflag=sync
```
```sh
job_name=$(echo $(uuidgen)| grep -o ".\{6\}$")
bs=1024K
count=256
sync=oflag=sync
threads=128

sudo mkdir -p /mnt/fsx/share/${job_name}/{1..128}

time seq 1 ${threads} | sudo parallel --will-cite -j ${threads} dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/fsx/share/${job_name}/{}/dd-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S.%3N) bs=${bs} count=${count} ${sync} &
```

- While the parallel dd command is running, run the **nload** command below for 10-20 seconds to monitor network throughput in real time
- Exit **nload** by pressing **Control+z**
- How long did it take to generate 32 GiB of data across 128 files?
- What was the average throughput of this test?
