== Summary

This section will load data into Amazon FSx for Lustre from the integrated Amazon S3 bucket (data repository).

The workshop environment created an FSx for Lustre file system with a data repository integrated with the "nasanex" bucket in the US West (Oregon) region. link:https://registry.opendata.aws/nasanex/[NASA NEX] is a part of the link:https://registry.opendata.aws/[Registry of Open Data on AWS] project and is a collection of Earth science datasets maintained by NASA, including climate change projections and satellite images of the Earth's surface.


== Duration

NOTE: It will take approximately 15 minutes to complete this section.


== Step-by-step Guide

IMPORTANT: Read through all steps below before continuing.

=== Lazy load data

Complete these steps from the SSH terminal session window connected to *Linux Instance 0*.

*_Copy_* the scripts below and *_paste_* it into your favorite text editor.
*_Copy_* the full path of one of the .tif files and *_replace_* the *_FILE_* placeholder.
*_Execute_* the script

. Generate a list of some .tif files
+
[source,bash]
----
time lfs find /mnt/fsx --type f --name *.tif | head 100

----
+
. Read the file and measure the time it takes to load it from the integrated S3 bucket. This command will load the file by reading it from S3 and writing it to tempfs on *Linux Instance 0*.
+
[source,bash]
----
time ls -lah FILE # e.g. time ls -lah /mnt/fsx/NAIP/ca_1m_2012/36117/m_3611718_nw_11_1_20120623.tif

----

My results are below. The file I'm using is 183 MB.

`-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 183M Aug 15  2014 /mnt/fsx/NAIP/ca_1m_2012/36117/m_3611718_nw_11_1_20120623.tif`

+
. Read the file and measure the time it takes to load it from the linked S3 bucket. This command will load the file by reading it from S3 and writing it to tempfs.
+
[source,bash]
----
time cat FILE >/dev/shm/fsx # e.g. time cat /mnt/fsx/NAIP/ca_1m_2012/36117/m_3611718_nw_11_1_20120623.tif >/dev/shm/fsx

. How long did it take? My results are below.
+
[source,bash]
----
real	0m4.702s
user	0m0.000s
sys	    0m0.152s
----
+
. *_Re-run_* the same **"time cat..."** command and see how long it takes? My results are below.
+
[source,bash]
----
real	0m0.110s
user	0m0.000s
sys	    0m0.108s

. The data *_read_* from the last command was delivered from where?::
The cache on *Linux Instance 0*. You can verify this by opening a second SSH terminal session window to this same instance and run `nload -u M` to see real-time network throughput of the instance. To force the *_read_* to go back to FSx for Lustre, drop the cache on *Linux Instance 0* and re-run the command.
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo bash -c 'echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches'
time cat FILE >/dev/shm/fsx # e.g. time cat /mnt/fsx/NAIP/ca_1m_2012/36117/m_3611718_nw_11_1_20120623.tif >/dev/shm/fsx
