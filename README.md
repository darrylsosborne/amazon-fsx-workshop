## Workshop Overview

### Overview

These workshops are designed to show solutions architects how to take advantage of our fully-managed 3rd party file systems. for various application workloads like home directories, web serving & content management, enterprise applications, analytics, and media & entertainment.

This workshop will cover how to create and initiate an incremental file-system-consistent backup of a file system, as well as how to access the file system from a broad range of clients from Windows and Linux EC2 instances to Amazon WorkSpaces and AppStream 2.0. We will also restore a backup as a new file system and setup Microsoft Distributed File System (DFS) Replication between two file systems across Availability Zones. For those of you who want to consolidate multiple file systems under a single namespace, we'll spend time setting up DFS Namespaces with two file systems to achieve double the capacity and throughput.
