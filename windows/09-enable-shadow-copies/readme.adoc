. From the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/[Amazon FSx] console, *_click_* the link to the *MAZ* file system and *_select_* the *Network & security* tab. *_Copy_* the *Windows Remote PowerShell Endpoint* of the file system to the clipboard (e.g. amznfsx0123abcde.example.com).

. Return to your favorite text editor and replace *"windows_remote_powershell_endpoint"* with the *Windows Remote PowerShell Endpoint* of *MAZ*. *_Copy_* the updated script.

. Go to the remote desktop session for your *Windows Instance 0*.

. *_Click_* *Start* >> *Windows PowerShell*.

. *_Run_* the updated script in the *Windows PowerShell* window.

NOTE: Complete the next few steps using the remote PowerShell session to the FSx file server.
+

. Review the PowerShell function commands for shadow copies available using the *Amazon FSx CLI for remote management on PowerShell*.
* *_Run_* the script in the *Remote Windows PowerShell Session*.

+
[source,bash]
----
Get-Command *-FSxShadow*
----
+

. What commands are available?

. Set shadow copy storage for the entire FSx file system. The default shadow copy storage setting lets shadow copies consume a maximum of 10 percent of your file system. The default schedule automatically takes shadow copies every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, at 7:00 AM and 12:00 PM UTC.
* *_Run_* the script in the *Remote Windows PowerShell Session*. *_Enter_* *A* for *Yes to All* when prompted to confirm.

+
[source,bash]
----
Set-FsxShadowStorage -Default
Set-FsxShadowCopySchedule -Default
----
+

. Examine the default shadow copy configuration using the commands in the table below.

+
|===
| *Command*
| Get-FSxShadowCopies

| Get-FSxShadowCopySchedule

| Get-FSxShadowStorage
|===
+

* What's the default schedule for shadow copies?
* How much space is allocated, used, and available for shadow copies?

NOTE: Shadow copies are stored alongside your ﬁle system's data, and therefore consume its storage capacity. However, shadow copies consume storage capacity only for the changed portions of ﬁles. All shadow copies stored in your ﬁle system are included in backups of your ﬁle system. Thus, when you restore a backup, users continue to have previous versions available as of the time that the ﬁle system was backed up. For more information on shadow copies, please read the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/shadow-copies-fsxW.html[Working with Shadow Copies] section in the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide[Amazon FSx for Windows File Server User Guide].
