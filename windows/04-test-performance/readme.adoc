== Summary

This section will test the performance of *Amazon FSx for Windows File Server 0*.

There are many disk performance tools out there. We have pre-installed link:https://aka.ms/diskspd[DiskSpd] and link:https://bluestop.org/fio/[fio] on the *Windows Server 0* instance. If you are familiar with another tool and would prefer using it to test performance, feel free to download and use it.


== Duration

NOTE: It will take approximately 30 minutes to complete this section.


== Step-by-step Guide

IMPORTANT: Read through all steps below before continuing.

=== Read test

. From the remote desktop session to *Windows Server 0*, *_open_* a PowerShell window.
+
IMPORTANT: This section assumes that *Amazon FSx for Windows File Server 0* is mapped as the *Z:/* drive. If your *Windows Server 0* does not have a mapped *Z:/* drive, map *Amazon FSx for Windows File Server 0* as the *Z:/* drive (see the previous section for step-by-step instructions).
+
. *_Run_* the script below to create a 100 GB sparse file
+
```sh
$random = $(Get-Random)
fsutil file createnew Z:\${env:computername}-$random.dat 100000000000
```
+
. Run the DiskSpeed script below to test read performance of the mapped **Z:** drive
+
```sh
C:\Tools\DiskSpd-2.0.21a\amd64\DiskSpd.exe -d120 -w0 -r -t1 -o32 -b64K -Su -L Z:\${env:computername}-$random.dat
```
+
While the script is running, open *Task Explorer* and monitor network performance (e.g. Task Explorer >> Performance (tab) >> Ethernet).
+
* What was the peak read throughput you achieved?
* What was the P99 (99th %-tile) of your test?
+
. Experiment with different DiskSpd parameter settings. Use the table below as a guide. Test with different block sizes (-b), number of outstanding I/O requests (-o), number of threads per file (-t), and enable/disable software caching (-Su).
+
[cols="3,10"]
|===
| Parameter | Description

| `-b<size>[K\|M\|G]`
a| Block size in bytes or KiB, MiB, or GiB (default = 64K).

| `-o<count>`
a| Number of outstanding I/O requests per-target per-thread. (1 = synchronous I/O, unless more than one thread is specified with by using `-F`.) (default = 2)

| `-r<size>[K\|M\|G]`
a| Random I/O aligned to the specified number of <alignment> bytes or KiB, MiB, GiB, or blocks. Overrides -s (default stride = block size).

| `-s<size>[K\|M\|G]`
a| Sequential stride size, offset between subsequent I/O operations in bytes or KiB, MiB, GiB, or blocks. Ignored if -r is specified (default access = sequential, default stride = block size).

| `-t<count>`
a| Number of threads per target. Conflicts with `-F`, which specifies the total number of threads.

| `-Sh`
a| Disable both software and hardware caching.

* What different parameters did you test?
* How did the different parameter options alter the results?


=== Write test

. From the remote desktop session to *Windows Server 0*, *_open_* a PowerShell window.
+
IMPORTANT: This section assumes that *Amazon FSx for Windows File Server 0* is mapped as the *Z:/* drive. If your *Windows Server 0* does not have a mapped *Z:/* drive, map *Amazon FSx for Windows File Server 0* as the *Z:/* drive (see the previous section for step-by-step instructions).
+
. Run the DiskSpeed script below to test write performance of the mapped **Z:** drive
+
```sh
$random = $(Get-Random)
C:\Tools\DiskSpd-2.0.21a\amd64\DiskSpd.exe -d120 -c2G -s64K -w100 -t1 -o32 -b64K -Sh -L Z:\${env:computername}-$random.dat
```
+
While the script is running, open *Task Explorer* and monitor network performance (e.g. Task Explorer >> Performance (tab) >> Ethernet).
+
* What was the peak write throughput you achieved?
* What was the P99 (99th %-tile) of your test?
+
. Experiment with different DiskSpd parameter settings. Use the table below as a guide. Test with different block sizes (-b), number of outstanding I/O requests (-o), number of threads per file (-t), random I/O (-r) or sequential I/O (-s), and enable/disable software & hardware write caching (-Sh).

| Parameter | Description

| `-d<seconds>`
a| Duration in seconds.

| `-b<size>[K\|M\|G]`
a| Block size in bytes or KiB, MiB, or GiB (default = 64K).

| `-r<size>[K\|M\|G]`
a| Random I/O aligned to the specified number of <alignment> bytes or KiB, MiB, GiB, or blocks. Overrides -s.

| `-s<size>[K\|M\|G]`
a| Sequential stride size, offset between subsequent I/O operations in bytes or KiB, MiB, GiB, or blocks. Ignored if -r is specified (default access = sequential, default stride = block size).

| `-o<count>`
a| Number of outstanding I/O requests per-target per-thread. (1 = synchronous I/O, unless more than one thread is specified with by using `-F`.) (default = 2)

| `-t<count>`
a| Number of threads per target. Conflicts with `-F`, which specifies the total number of threads.

| `-Sh`
a| Disables both software caching and hardware write caching.
