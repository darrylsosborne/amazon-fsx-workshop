. Return to the browser-based SSH connection of the *FSx/W Workshop Linux instance*.
+
TIP: If the SSH connection has timed out, e.g. the session is unresponsive, close the browser-based SSH connection window and create a new one. Return to the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/[Amazon EC2] console. *_Click_* the radio button next to the instance with the name *FSx/W Workshop Linux Instance*. *_Click_* the *Connect* button. *_Click_* the radio button next to  *EC2 Instance Connect (browser-based SSH connection)*.Leave the default user name as *ec2-user* and *_click_* *Connect*.
+
. Enter the following command to see which CIFS/SMB shares have been mounted.
+
[source,bash]
----
mount -t cifs

----
+

. Which CIFS/SMB file shares have been mounted?
NOTE: No shares should be mounted at this time.

. *_Copy_* the script below into your favorite text editor.
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo yum install cifs-utils -y

mountpoint=/fsx
dnsname="dns_name" # e.g. "amznfsx0123abcde.example.com"
username="admin@example.com"

sudo mkdir -p ${mountpoint}
sudo mount -t cifs //${dnsname}/share ${mountpoint} -o vers=2.0,user=${username}
----
+
. From the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/[Amazon FSx] console, *_click_* the link to the *MAZ* file system and *_select_* the *Network & security* tab. *_Click_* the image:copy-to-clipboard.png[align="left",width=20] shortcut next to the *DNS name* to *_copy_* the *DNS Name* to the clipboard.

. Return to your favorite text editor and replace *"dns_name"* with the *DNS name* in your clipboard. *_Copy_* the entire updated script to the clipboard.
+
TIP: Make sure you don't copy a hidden *new line* character after the script, otherwise the mount command will error out with: *mount error(115): Operation now in progres* after running it in the browser-based SSH connection in the next few steps.
+
. *_Return_* to the browser-based SSH connection of the *FSx/W Workshop Linux instance*.
+
TIP: If the SSH connection has timed out, e.g. the session is unresponsive, close the browser-based SSH connection window and create a new one.
+
. *_Paste_* and run the script you copied to the clipboard in the browser-based SSH connection window.

. *_Return_* to the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/[AWS Secrets Manager] console.
+
TIP: *_Context-click (right-click)_* the link above and open the link in a new tab or window to make it easy to navigate between this github workshop and AWS console.
+
. Use the *Secret key/value* pairs of *username* and *password* and copy the *password* to the clipboard.

. *_Paste_* the password from the clipboard in the browser-based SSH connection following the prompt (e.g. *Password for admin@example.com@//amznfsx0123abcde.example.com/share:*). The pasted password should be obfuscated (e.g. ************)

. Verify the mount command succeeded. *_Run_* the following commands in the browser-based SSH connection window:
+
[source,bash]
----
mount -t cifs
ll /fsx

----
+
. What information about the CIFS mount was returned?

. What directories and files do you see in the */fsx* mount point?

. How many files, directories, and data were preloaded from Amazon S3? *_Run_* the following command in the browser-based SSH connection window:
+
[source,bash]
----
time tree --du -h /fsx

----
+
* The output should look similar to this:
+
[source,bash]
