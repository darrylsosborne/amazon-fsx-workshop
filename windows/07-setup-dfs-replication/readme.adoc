== Summary

This section will setup a DFS Replication.

You use Microsoft PowerShell to setup DFS Replication for Amazon FSx for Windows File Server.


== Duration

NOTE: It will take approximately 30 minutes to complete this section.


== Step-by-step Guide

=== Connect to the Namespace server 0

IMPORTANT: Read through all steps below before continuing.

You should already have a remote desktop session open for *Namespace Server 0*.

. *_Close_* all open applications, windows, etc.

. *_Open_* a new *PowerShell* window as *Administrator* (e.g. *Start >> *_context-click_* *Window PowerShell* >> *More* >> *Run as Administrator*)

. *_Copy_* the script below and run it in the *Administrator: Windows PowerShell* window.
+
[source,bash]
----
$Group = "Group" # e.g. "ReplicationGroup"
$Folder = "Folder" # e.g. "folder"

New-DfsReplicationGroup -GroupName ${Group}
Grant-DfsrDelegation -GroupName ${Group} –AccountName "FSxAdmins" –Force
New-DfsReplicatedFolder -GroupName ${Group} -FolderName ${Folder}

----
+

. *_Copy_* the script below into your favorite text editor and replace *"Amazon FSx for Windows File Server 0"* with the DNS name of *Amazon FSx Windows File Server 0* and replace *"Amazon FSx for Windows File Server 1"* with the DNS name of *Amazon FSx Windows File Server 1*.  Run the updated script in the *Administrator: Windows PowerShell* window.
+
[source,bash]
----
$FirstFSDnsName = "Amazon FSx for Windows File Server 0" # e.g. "fs-abcdef0123456789.example.com"
$RestoredFSDnsName = "Amazon FSx for Windows File Server 1" # e.g. "fs-0123456789abcdef.example.com"
$FirstFSComputerName = (Resolve-DnsName ${FirstFSDnsName} -Type CNAME).NameHost
$RestoredFSComputerName = (Resolve-DnsName ${RestoredFSDnsName} -Type CNAME).NameHost

----
+

. *_Copy_* the script below and run it in the *Administrator: Windows PowerShell* window.

+
[source,bash]
----
Add-DfsrMember -GroupName ${Group} -ComputerName ${FirstFSComputerName}
Add-DfsrMember -GroupName ${Group} -ComputerName ${RestoredFSComputerName}

----
+

. *_Copy_* the script below and run it in the *Administrator: Windows PowerShell* window.

+
[source,bash]
----
$FirstFSReplicationPath = "D:\Share"
$RestoredFSReplicationPath = "D:\Share"

Set-DfsrMembership –GroupName ${Group} –FolderName ${Folder} –ContentPath ${FirstFSReplicationPath} –ComputerName ${FirstFSComputerName} –PrimaryMember $True -Force
Set-DfsrMembership –GroupName ${Group} –FolderName ${Folder} –ContentPath ${RestoredFSReplicationPath} –ComputerName ${RestoredFSComputerName} –PrimaryMember $False -Force

----
+

. *_Copy_* the script below and run it in the *Administrator: Windows PowerShell* window.

+
[source,bash]
----
Add-DfsrConnection -GroupName ${Group} -SourceComputerName ${FirstFSComputerName} -DestinationComputerName ${RestoredFSComputerName}

----


=== Test DFS Replication


. *_Open_* a new *File Explorer* window.

. Use the UNC path to connect to the default share of *Amazon FSx for Windows File Server 0* (e.g. \\fs-0123456789abcdef.example.com\share).

. *_Open_* a second *File Explorer* window.

. Use the UNC path to connect to the default share of *Amazon FSx for Windows File Server 1* (e.g. \\fs-9876543210abcdef.example.com\share).
+
TIP: It may take approximately 5 minutes for replication to start.
+

. Once you see the same files in both file systems, create new files in both file systems (e.g. *_context-click_* >> New >> Text Document.
+
* How long does it take for the newly created files to show up in the replicated file system?

. Experiment with different techniques to create files on a file system and see them get replicated.
+
TIP: Use the remote desktop session to the *Windows Server 0* instance to create new files using DiskSpd, fio, or fsutil. Change the path to use the new DFS Namespace (\\example.com\corp\share) or even the UNC path for *Amazon FSx for Windows File Server 1*.
