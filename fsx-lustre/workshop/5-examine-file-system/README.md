### Examine the file system

You must first complete [**Prerequisites**](../0-prerequisites) and the previous step [**Mount the file system**](../4-mount-file-system).

WARNING!! This workshop environment will exceed your free-usage tier. You will incur charges as a result of building this environment and completing the steps below.

### Step 5.1: Log on to the Linux EC2 instance

- From the Amazon EC2 Console, select the **Lustre client - FSx Workshop** instance
- Click **Connect**
- Use the connection information to SSH to the instance using your laptop's terminal application

### Step 5.2: Examine the file system's metadata loaded from the linked Amazon S3 bucket

> Complete the following steps SSH'd in to the **Lustre client - FSx Workshop** instance

- These commands assume you linked the file system to the entire NASA NEX bucket (s3://nasanex). If you selected a specific prefix from this bucket or used a different bucket, you'll need to adjust your examination criteria based on your dataset.

- How long did it take to load file metadata from the linked S3 bucket during file system creation?
**Hint** - Go to the CloudWatch dashboard created earlier and look at the **Operations per second (ops)** widget. Look at the start and end times of the heavy metadata operations period.

- What was the max operations per second (ops) during metadata load?
**Hint** - Go to the CloudWatch dashboard created earlier and look at the **Operations per second (ops)** widget. Move your cursor to find the max ops achieved.


- How long does it take to list the entire file system?

```sh
time lfs find /mnt/fsx
```

- What file types did you see?


- How many files?
```sh
time lfs find /mnt/fsx --type f | wc -l
```

- How many directories?
```sh
time lfs find /mnt/fsx --type d | wc -l
```

- How many small files (< 512 KiB)?
```sh
time lfs find /mnt/fsx --type f --size -512k | wc -l
```

- How many large files (> 100 MiB)?
```sh
time lfs find /mnt/fsx --type f --size +100M | wc -l
```

- How many .nc, .hdf, .tif, .gz files?
```sh
time lfs find /mnt/fsx --type f --name *.nc | wc -l
time lfs find /mnt/fsx --type f --name *.hdf | wc -l
time lfs find /mnt/fsx --type f --name *.tif | wc -l
time lfs find /mnt/fsx --type f --name *.gz | wc -l

```

- How much metadata (MDT) has been loaded into the file system?
- How much data (all the OSTs) has been loaded into the file system?
- How much data storage capacity is available?
```sh
time lfs df -h

```
