== Summary

The Amazon FSx File Gateway architecture has two components. The first component is the actional FSx File Gateway virtual or physical appliance, typically deployed on-premises. In this workshop it was deployed in Phase 2 - Deploy the Amazon FSx File Gateway environment in Region 2. The second component is the configuration of the FSx File Gateway service in the AWS Cloud. This service component attaches the FSx for Windows File Server to the FSx File Gateway. This FSx for Windows File Server was deployed in Phase 1 - Deploy the Amazon FSX for Windows File Server environment in Region 1.

Phase 3 will create the FSx File Gateway service components that connects the FSx File Gateway in Region 2 to the FSx for Windows File Server in Region 1.

It is a best practice to create a service account with minimum privileges to connect to Amazon FSx.
