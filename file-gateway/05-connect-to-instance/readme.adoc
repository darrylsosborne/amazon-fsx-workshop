. Launch your remote desktop application and create a new connection.
* Windows Users - use the built-in *Remote Desktop Connection* application.
* Mac Users - use the link:https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12/[Microsoft Remote Desktop] app available from the Mac App Store.

. Use the DNS name copied above as the host name of the new connection.

. Start a remote desktop session to the new connection (you will retrieve the *user name* and *password* from *AWS Secrets Manager*).

. Open the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/[AWS Secrets Manager] console.

TIP: If the domain credentials you used to authenticate and log on to the Windows instance don't work, wait another five minutes and try again. It could take 5-10 minutes for the Windows instance to launch and automatically join the example.com domain.
