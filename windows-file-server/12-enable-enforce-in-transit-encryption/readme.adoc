== Summary

This section will enable enforcement of in-transit encryption. Amazon FSx supports encryption of data in-transit using SMB 3 encryption, and allows unencrypted connections from compute instances that donâ€™t support SMB 3. You can now choose to enforce that access is allowed only via encrypted connections to meet your compliance needs.
